**TODO**

- Save Bookmark button should add script to page instead of literal JS
- Drag links to change category (category boxes are drag zones)
- Ability to re-arrange category boxes
- Add user account feature
- Capture link clicks in log
- Name, logo, favicon
- Ability to drag links off browser onto page (to add new bookmarks)

**IDEAS**

- Ability to store file links
